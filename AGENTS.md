# AGENTS.md: AI Code Generation Guidelines

## 1. The Vibe: Core Principles

The primary goal is to create web experiences that feel modern, intuitive, and emotionally resonant. The AI's output should reflect a "vibe" that is clean, delightful, and slightly playful, while remaining highly functional.

* **Aesthetics First**: Prioritize clean, modern, and visually appealing designs. The default aesthetic should be dark mode. Good design enhances usability and user satisfaction.
* **Seamless Interaction**: User flows must be intuitive and responsive. Every interaction should feel natural and provide immediate, understandable feedback.
* **Emotional Resonance**: Aim for outputs that evoke positive feelingsâ€”calm, efficiency, or delight. The interface should feel like a helpful partner, not a cold tool. Avoid frustration, confusion, or visual clutter.
* **Clarity & Readability**: The generated code itself should be a pleasure to read and understand, reflecting the same quality as the end-user experience.
* **Anticipatory Design**: Proactively address common user needs and potential pain points in the design and implementation.

## 2. Design Specifications

### Visual Aesthetics

* **Default to Dark Mode**: All designs should start with a dark theme. The primary background color should be a dark slate (slate-900 or slate-950).
* **Aurora Backgrounds**: For primary pages or dashboards, implement a subtle, slow-moving "aurora" background effect using CSS. This effect should use shades from the approved color palette (mauve, pink, rose) to create a gentle, shifting gradient behind the main content.
* **Color Palette**: Use a specific, harmonious color palette.
    * **Background**: slate-900 / slate-950
    * **Content Panels/Cards**: slate-800 / slate-900 with subtle borders (slate-700).
    * **Primary Accent/Action**: mauve-500 / pink-500
    * **Secondary Accent**: rose-500
    * **Text (Primary)**: slate-100 / slate-200
    * **Text (Secondary)**: slate-400
* **Typography**: Use the "Inter" font. Ensure text is highly legible with sufficient contrast.
* **Rounded Corners**: Apply rounded-lg or rounded-xl generously to all elements (buttons, cards, inputs, containers) for a soft, modern feel.
* **Icons**: Use lucide-react for all icons. They should be clean, consistent, and generally have a stroke-width of 1.5 for a lighter feel.
* **Layout**: Use ample whitespace and balanced layouts. Avoid clutter. All layouts must be fully responsive using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:).

### User Experience & Interaction

* **Bubble Buttons**: Buttons should have a "bubble-like" feel.
    * **Style**: Use a gradient from the accent colors (e.g., bg-gradient-to-br from-mauve-500 to-pink-500).
    * **Interaction**: On hover, the gradient should subtly shift or brighten. On click (active:), the button should scale down slightly (scale-95) to provide tactile feedback.
* **Smooth Transitions**: Employ subtle CSS transitions (transition-all duration-300) for all state changes (hover, focus, active) to make interactions feel fluid.
* **Clear Feedback**: Use non-intrusive loading indicators (like spinners or skeleton loaders) and custom-styled toast messages or modals for success/error states.
* **No Native Alerts**: Never use `alert()` or `confirm()`. They are disruptive and break the "vibe".

## 3. Architectural Mandates

* **Single-File Structure**: This project must be maintained within a single `index.html` file. All CSS (via Tailwind CDN), HTML, and JavaScript logic must reside in this file. Do not create or suggest external .js or .css files. This is a deliberate choice for project simplicity.
* **Global appState**: All application data and settings must be stored in the global `appState` object. Any function that changes what the user sees must do so by first modifying `appState` and then calling `updateUIFromAppState()`.

### Key Functions Overview

* **`appState` (Global Object)**: The single source of truth. Holds all card data, the current card index, and all user settings.
* **`updateUIFromAppState()`**: The primary rendering function. Call this after any change to `appState` to update the UI.
* **`saveState()` & `loadState()`**: Handle persistence to `localStorage`.
* **`generateCardHtml()`**: Generates the raw HTML for a card. This is a primary target for visual modifications.
* **`generatePdfDocument()`**: The core function for creating PDFs, containing complex logic for scaling and formatting.
* **`parseAndSetCardData()`**: The entry point for all JSON import logic.

## 4. Code Generation Instructions

* **Completeness**: Always provide self-contained, runnable code. No `...` placeholders.
* **Extensive Comments**: Comment everything to explain logic, algorithms, and the purpose of functions.
* **Error Handling**: Use `try/catch` blocks and provide user-friendly error messages through custom UI elements.
* **Modularity & DRY**: Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions. Don't Repeat Yourself.
* **Tailwind CSS ONLY**: Use only Tailwind CSS classes for all styling. Always include `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` in the `<head>`.

## 5. PDF Generation Logic (For Thermal Printers)

This process is specifically designed for continuous-feed thermal printers and requires a precise sequence to correctly scale a card's content to a narrow, physically constrained printable area.

### Key Concepts

* **Logical Size**: The ideal, intended dimensions of the card (e.g., a "Bridge" card is 2.25" wide by 3.5" long). The logical width is critical for determining the layout, text wrapping, and element flow of the card's content.
* **Printable Area Width**: A user-configurable setting based on the specific printer and paper combination. This is the maximum physical width that the printer can mark (e.g., 47mm on 58mm paper). This value dictates the final width of the PDF page itself.
* **Content Length**: Because the printer uses a continuous roll, the "page" length is variable. It is determined dynamically by the amount of content rendered within the logical width.

### PDF Generation Sequence

The AI must follow these steps exactly:

1.  **Render to Off-Screen Container**: Create a temporary, off-screen `<div>` element and append it to the `<body>`. This container must be styled to have the card's logical width (e.g., `style="width: 2.25in;"`) and be positioned off-screen (e.g., `position: absolute; left: -9999px;`).
2.  **Render Card Content**: Render the complete card content, generated by `generateCardHtml()`, inside this container.
3.  **Measure True Content Height**: Once the content is fully rendered in the off-screen container, measure its `scrollHeight`. This value represents the true, unconstrained height of the card content and will become the length of our PDF page.
4.  **Initialize PDF Document**: Using a library like `jsPDF`, create a new PDF document. The page dimensions must be set explicitly:
    * **Width**: The user-defined `printableAreaWidth`.
    * **Height**: The measured `scrollHeight` from Step 3.
5.  **Capture and Scale Content**: Use `html2canvas` to generate a canvas image of the off-screen container from Step 1. Then, draw this captured image onto the PDF page created in Step 3. The image must be scaled down proportionally to fit the `printableAreaWidth` while maintaining its original aspect ratio.
6.  **Handle Folded Cards**:
    * The entire front of the card is rendered and drawn onto the first page of the PDF as described above.
    * The back content is then rendered and drawn onto a second PDF page.
    * This second page must have the exact same dimensions as the first page.
    * The content on this back page must be rotated 180 degrees (`transform: rotate(180deg)`).
    * If the card front itself requires multiple pages, ensure the back page is added after all front pages, and that the total page count is even to facilitate duplex printing. Add a blank page if necessary before the final back page.
7.  **Optimize and Clean Up**: Use `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` settings that prioritize a small file size (< 10MB), such as adjusting image quality or resolution. After the PDF is generated, it is critical to remove the off-screen container from the DOM to prevent memory leaks or layout issues.

## 6. JSON Import Specifications

This section details the expected JSON formats for the "Import Cards" functionality.

### 1. `rpg-cards` Format

This format is based on the [rpg-cards project by crobi](https://crobi.github.io/rpg-cards/). The importer supports a subset of the official specification.

## 7. Walkthrough: Adding a New Feature 

**Scenario**: Add a 'rarity' badge to the top-left corner of a card.

1.  **Modify State**: First, add a `rarity` property (e.g., 'common', 'uncommon', 'rare') to the card object schema within the default `appState`.
2.  **Update HTML Generation**: Next, modify the `generateCardHtml()` function. Add a `div` that conditionally renders based on the `card.rarity` property.
3.  **Style with Tailwind**: Use Tailwind CSS to style the badge. It should be positioned absolutely and use the approved color palette. For example:
      * `rare` -\> `bg-mauve-500 text-white` 
      * `uncommon` -\> `bg-slate-600 text-slate-100` 
      * `common` -\> `bg-slate-700 text-slate-300` 
4.  **Trigger Render**: Ensure `updateUIFromAppState()` is called after the state changes. This function will call `updateCardPreview()`, which in turn uses the modified `generateCardHtml()`, automatically displaying the new badge[cite: 143]. No other functions need to be called.
