\## How to Use



\### 1. Editing Card Details



The "Card Details" section allows you to customize the front of your card:



\* \*\*Card Title:\*\* The main title of your card.



\* \*\*Card Type:\*\* A subtitle or category for your card (e.g., "Spell," "Item," "Creature").



\* \*\*Icon Name or Image URL:\*\*



&nbsp;   \* Enter a Font Awesome icon name (e.g., `magic-swirl`, `crossed-swords`) to display a scalable icon.



&nbsp;   \* Alternatively, paste a direct URL to an image (e.g., `https://example.com/my-icon.png`).



\* \*\*Card Color (Hex, Optional):\*\* Select a color for the card's background. This is primarily for color photo printing; thermal printers will convert to grayscale.



\* \*\*Content Sections:\*\*



&nbsp;   \* Click "Add Section" to add new content blocks.



&nbsp;   \* Each section can have an optional \*\*Heading\*\*, \*\*Body Text\*\* (supports `\*\*bold\*\*`, `\*italic\*`, and `\[links](url)`), and optional \*\*Flavor Text\*\* (displayed in italic).



&nbsp;   \* Use the "X" button to remove a section.



\* \*\*Stats (Key-Value Pairs):\*\*



&nbsp;   \* Click "Add Stat" and enter a stat name (e.g., "HP", "STR", "Damage").



&nbsp;   \* Enter the corresponding value for the stat.



&nbsp;   \* Use the "X" button to remove a stat.



\* \*\*Tags (Comma-separated):\*\* Enter keywords related to your card, separated by commas (e.g., `Fire, Spell, Evocation`).



\* \*\*Footer Text (Optional):\*\* Small text displayed at the bottom of the card (e.g., "Source: PHB").



\### 2. Card Folding Options



\* \*\*Folded Card Checkbox:\*\* Check this box to enable the back/bottom content for a folded card design.



\* \*\*Content Type:\*\* Choose what appears on the back of the card:



&nbsp;   \* \*\*Text:\*\* Enter plain text.



&nbsp;   \* \*\*Image URL:\*\* Paste a URL to an image for the back.



&nbsp;   \* \*\*QR Code:\*\* Enter data (e.g., a URL) to generate a QR code on the back.



\### 3. Navigating Multiple Cards



The "Navigate Cards" section helps you manage multiple card entries:



\* \*\*Previous / Next Buttons:\*\* Cycle through the loaded cards.



\* \*\*Card Select Dropdown:\*\* Choose a specific card by its title from the list.



\* \*\*Add New Empty Card:\*\* Create a blank card to start a new design.



\### 4. Importing Card Data



You can import existing card data from JSON files or pasted JSON:



\* \*\*Import from rpg-cards.vercel.app (.json file):\*\* Upload a JSON file generated by or compatible with the `rpg-cards.vercel.app` tool.



\* \*\*Paste JSON from 5e.tools/makecards.html or 5e.tools/converter.html:\*\* Paste JSON data copied directly from these 5e.tools utilities.



\* \*\*Paste Generic JSON:\*\* Paste any other JSON data that roughly matches the internal card structure. The application will attempt to map fields.



\*\*Note:\*\* When importing multiple cards from a JSON file, all cards will be loaded into the application, and you can navigate them using the "Navigate Cards" section.



\### 5. Printer Settings \& Preview



\* \*\*Select Printer Type:\*\*



&nbsp;   \* \*\*Thermal Receipt Printer (Monochrome):\*\* Optimizes the preview and output for black-and-white thermal printers.



&nbsp;   \* \*\*Color Photo Printer (Kodak Zink / Fujifilm Instax):\*\* Optimizes the preview and output for color photo printers.



\* \*\*Thermal Paper Size:\*\* (Only visible for Thermal Printer type) Select the paper width (58mm or 80mm) to adjust the preview and print output.



\* \*\*Number of Copies (1-10):\*\* Specify how many copies of the card(s) you want to print or download.



\* \*\*Card Preview:\*\* A live representation of your card, updating as you make changes.



\* \*\*Print/Export Scope:\*\*



&nbsp;   \* \*\*Current Card:\*\* Only the currently displayed card will be processed for printing or downloading.



&nbsp;   \* \*\*All Cards:\*\* All cards loaded in the application will be processed.



\### 6. Printing and Exporting



\* \*\*Print Thermal Card:\*\* (Visible for Thermal Printer type) Sends a print command to a compatible thermal printer application on your mobile device (e.g., via Android App Link or iOS Mobile Print Util).



\* \*\*Print Color Photo Card:\*\* (Visible for Color Printer type) Generates a high-resolution image of the card(s) and attempts to share it with compatible photo printer apps via the Web Share API. If not supported, it will prompt you to download.



\* \*\*Download Card Image(s):\*\* Downloads the current card (or all cards, based on scope) as a PNG image file(s).



\* \*\*Share Card (via Web Share API):\*\* Attempts to share the current card's image with other applications on your device (e.g., messaging apps, cloud storage).



\* \*\*Copy Bookmarkable Link:\*\* Generates a unique URL that encodes the current card's data and settings. You can save this link to easily return to your design later or share it with others.



\## Important Notes



\* \*\*Printer Compatibility:\*\* Direct printing from a web browser to a thermal or photo printer is generally not possible without a dedicated mobile application that supports URL schemes or image sharing. This web app generates data/images in a format compatible with such mobile printing utility apps.



\* \*\*Font Awesome Icons:\*\* The application uses Font Awesome for many of its icons. If you enter an icon name (e.g., `magic-swirl`) that is not a full URL, it will attempt to render it as a Font Awesome icon.



\* \*\*Offline Access (PWA):\*\* This application is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA). If accessed via HTTPS or localhost, it should prompt you to install it to your home screen, allowing for offline use.



\* \*\*Data Persistence:\*\* Your card data and application settings are saved in your browser's local storage, so they will persist even if you close and reopen the browser tab.



Enjoy generating your TTRPG cards!
